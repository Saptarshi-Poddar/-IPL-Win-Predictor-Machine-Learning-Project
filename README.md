# -IPL-Win-Predictor-Machine-Learning-Project
This project is a Machine Learning-based web application built to predict the win probability of an IPL team during a live match scenario. The app takes in real-time match inputs (teams, city, target, score, overs, wickets) and returns the predicted chances of both batting and bowling teams winning the match.
